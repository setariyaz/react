/*
Sequence Control
Sometimes you would like to have better control over when to execute a function.

Suppose you want to do a calculation, and then display the result.
You could call a calculator function (addition), save the result, and then call another function (displayResult) to display the result:
*/

const addition = (a,b) => a+b;
const displayResult = result => document.write("<br>Addition : " + result);
let sum = addition(10,20);
displayResult(sum);
