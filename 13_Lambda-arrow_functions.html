Arrow function with Rest parameters:
Rest parameters do not restrict you to pass the number of values in a function, but all the passed values must be of the same type. 
We can also say that rest parameters act as the placeholders for multiple arguments of the same type.
For declaring the rest parameter, the parameter name should be prefixed with the spread operator that has three periods(…)(not more than three or not less than three).
